"""schema_view: contracts handling for the cordage-relay pipeline.

This module owns the schema stage. It is called by checkpoint_store and calls into attestation_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
