"""checkpoint_store: durability handling for the cordage-relay pipeline.

This module owns the checkpoint stage. It is called by attestation_gate and calls into throttle_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: P. Ravindran (Platform Reliability).
