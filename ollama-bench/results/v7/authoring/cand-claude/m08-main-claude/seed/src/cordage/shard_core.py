"""shard_core: placement handling for the cordage-relay pipeline.

This module owns the shard stage. It is called by checkpoint_store and calls into attestation_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Compliance Review).
