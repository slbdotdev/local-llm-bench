"""dispatch_core: fanout handling for the fenwick-conduit pipeline.

This module owns the dispatch stage. It is called by reconcile_store and calls into backfill_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: R. Okonjo (Compliance Review).
