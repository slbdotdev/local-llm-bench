"""audit_flow: evidence handling for the talus-gate pipeline.

This module owns the audit stage. It is called by attestation_store and calls into dispatch_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: M. Lindqvist (Platform Reliability).
