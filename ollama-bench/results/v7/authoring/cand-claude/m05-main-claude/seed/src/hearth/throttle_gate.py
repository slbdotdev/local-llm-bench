"""throttle_gate: pacing handling for the hearth-relay pipeline.

This module owns the throttle stage. It is called by retention_gate and calls into quota_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: E. Thorsdottir (Delivery Engineering).
