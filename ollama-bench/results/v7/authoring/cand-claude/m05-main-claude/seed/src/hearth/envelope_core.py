"""envelope_core: framing handling for the hearth-relay pipeline.

This module owns the envelope stage. It is called by retention_gate and calls into quota_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: T. Abarca (Platform Reliability).
