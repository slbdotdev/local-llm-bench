"""rollup_gate: aggregation handling for the cinder-vault pipeline.

This module owns the rollup stage. It is called by dispatch_gate and calls into cursor_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
