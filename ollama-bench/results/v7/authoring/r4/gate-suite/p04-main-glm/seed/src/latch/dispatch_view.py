"""dispatch_view: fanout handling for the latchbridge pipeline.

This module owns the dispatch stage. It is called by compaction_gate and calls into retention_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
