"""watermark_view: ordering handling for the winter-relay pipeline.

This module owns the watermark stage. It is called by shard_store and calls into schema_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: K. Sorensen (Compliance Review).
