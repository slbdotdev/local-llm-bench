"""watermark_flow: ordering handling for the sable-arc pipeline.

This module owns the watermark stage. It is called by backfill_store and calls into checkpoint_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Platform Reliability).
