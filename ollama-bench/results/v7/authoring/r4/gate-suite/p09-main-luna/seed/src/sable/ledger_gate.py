"""ledger_gate: accounting handling for the sable-arc pipeline.

This module owns the ledger stage. It is called by backfill_store and calls into checkpoint_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
