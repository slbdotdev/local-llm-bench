"""checkpoint_flow: durability handling for the sable-arc pipeline.

This module owns the checkpoint stage. It is called by backfill_store and calls into shard_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
