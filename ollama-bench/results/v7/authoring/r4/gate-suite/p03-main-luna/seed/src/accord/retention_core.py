"""retention_core: lifecycle handling for the sable-accord pipeline.

This module owns the retention stage. It is called by replay_store and calls into watermark_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: K. Sorensen (Data Stewardship).
