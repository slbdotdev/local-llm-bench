"""backfill_core: repair handling for the sable-accord pipeline.

This module owns the backfill stage. It is called by replay_store and calls into watermark_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: R. Okonjo (Platform Reliability).
