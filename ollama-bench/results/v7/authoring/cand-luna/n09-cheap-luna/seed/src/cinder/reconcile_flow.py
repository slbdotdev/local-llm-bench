"""reconcile_flow: settlement handling for the cinder-parcel pipeline.

This module owns the reconcile stage. It is called by audit_view and calls into schema_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
