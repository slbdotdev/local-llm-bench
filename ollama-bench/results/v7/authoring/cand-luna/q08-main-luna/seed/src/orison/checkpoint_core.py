"""checkpoint_core: durability handling for the orison-thread pipeline.

This module owns the checkpoint stage. It is called by attestation_view and calls into audit_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Capacity Planning).
