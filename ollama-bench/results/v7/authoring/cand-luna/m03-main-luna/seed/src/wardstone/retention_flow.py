"""retention_flow: lifecycle handling for the wardstone-flux pipeline.

This module owns the retention stage. It is called by lineage_view and calls into schema_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: N. Oyelaran (Compliance Review).
