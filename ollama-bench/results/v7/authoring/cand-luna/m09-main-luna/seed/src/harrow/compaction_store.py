"""compaction_store: storage handling for the harrow-vane pipeline.

This module owns the compaction stage. It is called by tenancy_flow and calls into quota_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
