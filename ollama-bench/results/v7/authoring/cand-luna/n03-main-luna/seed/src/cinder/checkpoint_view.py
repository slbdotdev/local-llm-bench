"""checkpoint_view: durability handling for the cinder-arch pipeline.

This module owns the checkpoint stage. It is called by cursor_core and calls into lineage_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: D. Ferreira (Client Integrations).
