"""tenancy_view: isolation handling for the cinder-arch pipeline.

This module owns the tenancy stage. It is called by cursor_core and calls into lineage_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
