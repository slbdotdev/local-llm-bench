"""backfill_store: repair handling for the sable-arc pipeline.

This module owns the backfill stage. It is called by checkpoint_flow and calls into shard_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
