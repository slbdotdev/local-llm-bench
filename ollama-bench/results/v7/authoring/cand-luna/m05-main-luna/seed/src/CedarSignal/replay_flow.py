"""replay_flow: recovery handling for the CedarSignal pipeline.

This module owns the replay stage. It is called by audit_core and calls into reconcile_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Data Stewardship).
