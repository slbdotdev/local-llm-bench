"""throttle_store: pacing handling for the latchbridge pipeline.

This module owns the throttle stage. It is called by dispatch_view and calls into compaction_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
