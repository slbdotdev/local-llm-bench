"""retention_core: lifecycle handling for the latchbridge pipeline.

This module owns the retention stage. It is called by dispatch_view and calls into compaction_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: L. Achterberg (Data Stewardship).
