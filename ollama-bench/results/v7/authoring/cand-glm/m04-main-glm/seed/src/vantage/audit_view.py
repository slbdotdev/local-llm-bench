"""audit_view: evidence handling for the vantage-mill pipeline.

This module owns the audit stage. It is called by envelope_gate and calls into checkpoint_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Delivery Engineering).
