"""shard_store: placement handling for the vantage-mill pipeline.

This module owns the shard stage. It is called by envelope_gate and calls into checkpoint_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: M. Lindqvist (Client Integrations).
