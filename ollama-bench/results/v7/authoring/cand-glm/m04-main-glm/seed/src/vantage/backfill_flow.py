"""backfill_flow: repair handling for the vantage-mill pipeline.

This module owns the backfill stage. It is called by envelope_gate and calls into checkpoint_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: C. Batbayar (Platform Reliability).
