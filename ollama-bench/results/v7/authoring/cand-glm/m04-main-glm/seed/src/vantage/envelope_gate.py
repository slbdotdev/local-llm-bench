"""envelope_gate: framing handling for the vantage-mill pipeline.

This module owns the envelope stage. It is called by checkpoint_gate and calls into schema_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: K. Sorensen (Compliance Review).
