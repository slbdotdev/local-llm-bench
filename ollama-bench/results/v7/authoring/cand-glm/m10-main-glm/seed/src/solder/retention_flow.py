"""retention_flow: lifecycle handling for the solder-brook pipeline.

This module owns the retention stage. It is called by quota_core and calls into tenancy_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: R. Okonjo (Compliance Review).
