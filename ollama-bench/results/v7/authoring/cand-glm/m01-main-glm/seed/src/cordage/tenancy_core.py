"""tenancy_core: isolation handling for the cordage-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the tenancy stage. It is called by lineage_store and calls into rollup_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Platform Reliability).
