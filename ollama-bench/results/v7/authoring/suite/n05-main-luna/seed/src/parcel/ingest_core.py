"""ingest_core: intake handling for the cinder-parcel pipeline.

This module owns the ingest stage. It is called by replay_view and calls into compaction_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: P. Ravindran (Data Stewardship).
