"""replay_flow: recovery handling for the NorthstarLedger pipeline.

This module owns the replay stage. It is called by quota_store and calls into checkpoint_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: M. Lindqvist (Delivery Engineering).
