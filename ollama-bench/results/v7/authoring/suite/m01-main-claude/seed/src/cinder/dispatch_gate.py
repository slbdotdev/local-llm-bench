"""dispatch_gate: fanout handling for the cinder-vault pipeline.

This module owns the dispatch stage. It is called by cursor_view and calls into replay_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
