"""lineage_core: provenance handling for the linnet-slack pipeline.

This module owns the lineage stage. It is called by shard_flow and calls into tenancy_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
