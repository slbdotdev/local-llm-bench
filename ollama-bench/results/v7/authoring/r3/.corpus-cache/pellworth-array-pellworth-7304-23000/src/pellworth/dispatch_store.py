"""dispatch_store: fanout handling for the pellworth-array pipeline.

This module owns the dispatch stage. It is called by attestation_core and calls into digest_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
