"""backfill_view: repair handling for the vardy-loom pipeline.

This module owns the backfill stage. It is called by lineage_gate and calls into ingest_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
