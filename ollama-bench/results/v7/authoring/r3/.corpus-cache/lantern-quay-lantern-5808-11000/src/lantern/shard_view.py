"""shard_view: placement handling for the lantern-quay pipeline.

This module owns the shard stage. It is called by attestation_view and calls into audit_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: H. Bergstrom (Delivery Engineering).
