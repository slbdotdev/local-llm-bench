"""replay_view: recovery handling for the cinder-parcel pipeline.

This module owns the replay stage. It is called by compaction_view and calls into reconcile_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: H. Bergstrom (Capacity Planning).
