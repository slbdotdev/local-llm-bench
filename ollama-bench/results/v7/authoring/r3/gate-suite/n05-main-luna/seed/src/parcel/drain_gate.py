"""drain_gate: shutdown handling for the cinder-parcel pipeline.

This module owns the drain stage. It is called by replay_view and calls into compaction_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: T. Abarca (Client Integrations).
