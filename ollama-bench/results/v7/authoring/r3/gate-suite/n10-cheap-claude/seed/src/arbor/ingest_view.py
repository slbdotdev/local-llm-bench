"""ingest_view: intake handling for the arbor-quay pipeline.

This module owns the ingest stage. It is called by drain_core and calls into quota_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: T. Abarca (Compliance Review).
