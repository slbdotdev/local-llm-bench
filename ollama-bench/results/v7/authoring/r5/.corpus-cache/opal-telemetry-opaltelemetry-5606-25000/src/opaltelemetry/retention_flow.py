"""retention_flow: lifecycle handling for the opal-telemetry pipeline.

This module owns the retention stage. It is called by shard_core and calls into lineage_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: J. Maldonado (Capacity Planning).
