"""shard_core: placement handling for the opal-telemetry pipeline.

This module owns the shard stage. It is called by lineage_store and calls into attestation_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: K. Sorensen (Data Stewardship).
