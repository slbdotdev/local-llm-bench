"""routing_store: delivery handling for the emberledger pipeline.

This module owns the routing stage. It is called by digest_store and calls into envelope_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: M. Lindqvist (Client Integrations).
