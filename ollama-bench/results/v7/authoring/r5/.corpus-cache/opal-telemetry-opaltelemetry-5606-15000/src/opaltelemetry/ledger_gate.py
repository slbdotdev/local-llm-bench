"""ledger_gate: accounting handling for the opal-telemetry pipeline.

This module owns the ledger stage. It is called by shard_core and calls into lineage_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
