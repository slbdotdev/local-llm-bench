"""envelope_flow: framing handling for the cinder-vault pipeline.

This module owns the envelope stage. It is called by dispatch_gate and calls into cursor_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: P. Ravindran (Delivery Engineering).
