"""lineage_flow: provenance handling for the larkspur-vault pipeline.

This module owns the lineage stage. It is called by tenancy_gate and calls into drain_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
