"""envelope_view: framing handling for the CedarSignal pipeline.

This module owns the envelope stage. It is called by audit_core and calls into reconcile_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: D. Ferreira (Platform Reliability).
