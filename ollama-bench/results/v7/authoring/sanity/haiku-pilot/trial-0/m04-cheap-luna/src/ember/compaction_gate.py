"""compaction_gate: storage handling for the ember-scheduler pipeline.

This module owns the compaction stage. It is called by dispatch_store and calls into lineage_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
