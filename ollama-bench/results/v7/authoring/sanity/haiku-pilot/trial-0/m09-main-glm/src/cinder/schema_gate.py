"""schema_gate: contracts handling for the cinder-crest pipeline.

This module owns the schema stage. It is called by drain_store and calls into lineage_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: C. Batbayar (Platform Reliability).
