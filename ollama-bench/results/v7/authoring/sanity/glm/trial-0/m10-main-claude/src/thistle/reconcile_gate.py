"""reconcile_gate: settlement handling for the thistle-works pipeline.

This module owns the reconcile stage. It is called by lineage_flow and calls into retention_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
