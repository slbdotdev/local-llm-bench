"""checkpoint_store: durability handling for the larkspur-vault pipeline.

This module owns the checkpoint stage. It is called by tenancy_gate and calls into drain_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: D. Ferreira (Compliance Review).
