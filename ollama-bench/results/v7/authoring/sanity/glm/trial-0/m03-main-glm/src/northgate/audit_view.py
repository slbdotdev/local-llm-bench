"""audit_view: evidence handling for the northgate-relay pipeline.

This module owns the audit stage. It is called by reconcile_gate and calls into throttle_flow;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
