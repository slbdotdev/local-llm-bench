"""routing_flow: delivery handling for the NorthstarLedger pipeline.

This module owns the routing stage. It is called by quota_store and calls into checkpoint_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
