"""rollup_gate: aggregation handling for the harrow-exchange pipeline.

This module owns the rollup stage. It is called by tenancy_gate and calls into routing_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
