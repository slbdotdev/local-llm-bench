"""shard_flow: placement handling for the HarborAtlas pipeline.

This module owns the shard stage. It is called by compaction_gate and calls into lineage_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: M. Lindqvist (Client Integrations).
