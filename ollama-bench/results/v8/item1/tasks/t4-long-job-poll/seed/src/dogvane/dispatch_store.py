"""dispatch_store: fanout handling for the dogvane-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the dispatch stage. It is called by retention_gate and calls into lineage_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
