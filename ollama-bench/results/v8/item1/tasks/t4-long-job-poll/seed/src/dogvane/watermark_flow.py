"""watermark_flow: ordering handling for the dogvane-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the watermark stage. It is called by retention_gate and calls into lineage_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.

Ownership: K. Sorensen (Compliance Review).
