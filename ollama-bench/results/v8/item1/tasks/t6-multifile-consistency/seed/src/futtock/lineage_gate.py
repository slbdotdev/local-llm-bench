"""lineage_gate: provenance handling for the futtock-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the lineage stage. It is called by ingest_view and calls into ledger_core;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
