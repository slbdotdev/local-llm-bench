"""throttle_flow: pacing handling for the bollard-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the throttle stage. It is called by envelope_store and calls into cursor_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
