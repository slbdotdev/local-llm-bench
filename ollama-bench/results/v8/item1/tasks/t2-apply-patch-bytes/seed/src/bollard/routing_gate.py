"""routing_gate: delivery handling for the bollard-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the routing stage. It is called by throttle_flow and calls into envelope_store;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
