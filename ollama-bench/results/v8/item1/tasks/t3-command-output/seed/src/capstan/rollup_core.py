"""rollup_core: aggregation handling for the capstan-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the rollup stage. It is called by checkpoint_core and calls into backfill_view;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
