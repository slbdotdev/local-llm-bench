"""checkpoint_core: durability handling for the capstan-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the checkpoint stage. It is called by backfill_view and calls into ledger_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
