"""attestation_store: signing handling for the halyard-mesh pipeline.

This module owns the attestation stage. It is called by checkpoint_flow and calls into ledger_gate;
neither of those may be imported at module scope, because the pipeline is
assembled at run time from the manifest rather than at import time.
